How to determine the quality of a video file?

To determine the quality of a video file:
1) View two video clips or an entire movie.
2) If the file is written by a renowned release group, it itself reliably describes the quality.
3) If the visual definition of quality is suspicious and the known video file was created by a known release group and there is no definite information that could indicate that the file name is of the wrong quality (the original from which the file was received may be wrong and indicate the wrong quality) Can be done.
We find on the Internet at least 3 or 4 video files with exactly the same technical characteristics. Technical specifications can be obtained through the Gspot program.
And see what qualities are displayed. If the 3 sources represent quality (TS) and one DVD-Rip, then these are all the same screen (TS). A completely different video file if the technical characteristics of a file available on the Internet are at least slightly different from that of the file.

Download quality movies for maximum enjoyment. Even though it's a g@vno... full of the plot of the movie itself

In the description of the movie on a decent torrent tracker (eg rutreker.org), you will usually see the abbreviation "quality" such as DVDRip, CAMRip, TS, TC, DVDSrc, BDRip, HDRip, etc. Thanks to this, you can learn how to make a compressed film copy and get a rough idea of ​​the quality of the image and sound of the downloaded video. Here is a copy of the most commonly used symbols.

The quality of the film increases from top to bottom. That said, CamRip is the worst quality and Telesync gets a bit better, so DVD9 and HDTV are the best. So, if you have two versions of movies with different qualities, like CamRip and DVDRip, we recommend downloading the best movies from DVDRip.

CAMRip (CAM) is
  also known as "screen". This quality is very low in sound and video quality. Get this video by recording a movie in the cinema with a video camera. Videos of this quality first appear on the pirate counters on DVDs, torrents and versions. Often you can see silhouettes of people in the video. You can usually see the silhouettes of people. Part of the screen will not be displayed on the TV and monitor screens as the camera may not be installed smoothly. In general, such films are suitable only for the most impatient viewers. For the rest, it makes sense for those with strong pride to wait for a better version.


  "Screen" like CAMRIP PROPER , but shot better. In other words, the film was shot more skillfully with a higher level of equipment.


  Video taken from the screen in a TS (Telesync) movie. The difference with CAMRip is that it shoots projection film with a professional camera this time. The camera usually stands on a tripod and the sound is written directly from the film rig. Usually it has a good picture (far from ideal) and a good sound (sometimes stereo).


  Similar to TS PROPER CAMRip PROPER.

SuperTS (Super Telesync, Super-TS, Digitization)
  computerized TS material. Colors are processed, everything is aligned and noise is removed. Usually pretty good movie quality. The quality of the final processing result depends on the quality of the original recording, the equipment used and the mastery of master removal and processing.

TC (telecine)
video is copied directly from a special equipment film or projector with digital output. The video quality is good, the sound is great (prepare a stereo system). It may be impossible to distinguish it from a licensed DVD, but in other words, it depends on your equipment.

DVDRip (DVD-Rip)
  Copy from a good quality DVD (rental or purchased). DVD movies are usually large (about 9 GB), and this disc is cut off. For DVDRip, use 2 possible file sizes (700MB and 1400MB). The latter is often indistinguishable from the original DVD.

VHSScr (VHS Screen, SCR, Screen)

Files recorded from digital/satellite television. Excellent image and sound quality. High-definition video has a resolution of 1920 × 1080 or 1280 × 720. The sound is digital, usually Dolby Digital 5.1. Playing videos of this standard requires special equipment (monitor/TV and player standard HD) to display the video in full resolution. Otherwise, it makes no sense to download such a file. Usually the photo has a channel logo.

BDRip (BD-Rip, BRRip, BR-Rip)
  Blu-ray disc extraction. It provides the best picture and sound quality. Photos are available in high definition resolutions of 1920 × 1080 or 1280 × 720. Usually the file size is customized for DVD5 and DVD9.

HDDVDRip (HD-DVD-Rip, HDDVD-Rip)
  Same as BDRip, but can rip using HD DVD. It's pretty rare now. HD DVD cannot compete with Blu-Ray and has inferior technical specifications.

HD-DVD-Rip   (HDDVDRip, HDDVD-Rip, HDDVD)

Rip to HD DVD disc (15GB per layer). See HDTV. The number of such rips doesn't matter when it comes to real losses in the war between format Blu-ray and HD DVD.

Laser Disc -RIP   (LDRip)

Similar to DVDRip. This version was made with a laser disc. It's a pretty rare, mostly old movie.

VHS-Rip (VHSRip)
  Original material cassette VHS format, medium average quality.
Other abbreviations:
720p, 1080p, 1080i, 1280p, etc.-The name is found on HDTV film.
  The picture is the vertical resolution of a picture with a 16:9 aspect ratio. Example: 720p-1280x720

I   (interlaced scan)-interlaced scan, the image consists of two half frames (as in normal television). This reduces the flow (hence the file size), but allows you to see the so-called motion. There is a "comb effect" on the border of the color. Frequency 50 or 60 frames per second

Blood   (Progressive Scan)-For progressive scan, the frame is transmitted and formed as a whole, but the picture in motion is not distorted. The downside of the progressive method is that the stream is doubled compared to the interlaced method. As a result, the file size increases or the frame rate is slow.

Full Screen (FS)

Fullscreen release, 3:4 video resolution Often Fullscreen uses the Pan and Scan (PS) method in its widescreen version to cut out a portion of the frame.

Wide screen (WS)

Typically 16:9 widescreen video. When viewed on a normal screen with an aspect ratio of 3:4, black bars appear at the top and bottom of the screen.

DUPE
  the second release of the same film by another release group (usually the first release)

Director's Cut (DC)

The director's version is a special edition of the film that represents the film from the director's point of view and is not edited according to the requirements of customers, distributors, studios, film critics, etc.

The original sound is removed from the film. For example, they took tracks from Russian cinemas and released them in the American version.

Line.Dubbed

Like Dubbed, only this sound comes from the "chair" or "projector" (line).

Letter box

Same as widescreen (WS).

The film has been shown in a limited number of cinemas. Usually 250-500 or less.

MIC.
  Same as Dubbed, only sound was recorded from the cinema's microphone.

The previous movie was of poor quality (sometimes by different groups), so re-release the movie.

Convert the release to another format or re-encode it.

New lip movie.

Special Edition (SE)

Special edition. Notable examples include the renovated version of Star Wars, which added computer graphics, animation, and 3D models to materials from the 70s.

Straight to Video (STV)

The movie immediately appeared on a DVD/cassette bypassing the cinema. Quality-DVDrip or VHSrip respectively.

A movie with a subtitle.

Watermark
  small logo TV channel or relizer.

When you select a movie to watch, first check its quality. The picture is good, the sound is pleasant, and the translation is clear. If you want to download and watch a good movie and know what all the symbols mean besides the name, read this article.

Image quality:
  -Poor quality (Camrip, Telesync)
  -Good quality (TVrip, Satrip, DVDScr, WP)-Excellent
  quality (DVDRip, Telecine, HDRip)-Excellent
  quality (BDRip, HDDVDRip, HDTVRip)

Sound quality:
  -Single channel sound (mono)
  -2 channel sound (stereo)
  -Multi channel sound (Dolby Digital, DTS Surround Sound)

Movie Translation:
  -Duplicated
  -Off Screen
  -Subtitles
  -Original Sound

Let's take a closer look at each concept.

Image quality
  Poor Quality   -This is the quality we can watch the movie for, but we don't get any definite pleasure. Since the special effects used in the movie have not been fully disclosed, the actor's image looks blurry and resembles a bad photo on a bad phone. The color is unnatural. In general, everything is bad. You can see it, but it's not necessary.

The main formats of low quality are: Camrip   and Telesync . The second is slightly better, but not much.

what?   CAMRip (CAM, Ekranka)-lowest   quality. On the movie screen, some people are recording videos on the camera. At some point, you can stand up and see the viewer's head, and the camera can move, resulting in a “shaking” image. If the camera is not in focus, the image may be cropped at the edges. The sound quality of such recordings is different, so you can hear the voice in the movie. You may hear laughter in a voice that the movie doesn't offer, especially at fun moments (people laugh at the movie)



what?   Telesync (TS)-Better   quality than the screen. The most commonly used digital professional camera installed in empty cinemas on a tripod. Thanks to a better camera, the image quality is improved due to the tripod. The image does not dance and is cropped smaller than some screens. Sound is recorded directly from the projector or sometimes in stereo. In general, without "laughs" and other interference. Often better quality rips are heard "sound in TS" before an officially duplicated translation is released.



Good quality -with this quality, the movie is already very interesting. The sound depends on the source and is suitable for viewing in most cases. The picture does not smudge, but the eyes need more. If a movie is worth it, it should and should have a watch.

what? Screener, DVDScreener (SCR, DVDScr)-near   "very good" quality. In this format, materials are used in promotional materials and on critics and promotional DVDs. The picture quality is similar to a good VHS or DVD. The sound is great too. It's usually stereo or Dolby surround (if it's the original translated source code). Sometimes DVDScr has counters, captions, and black and white inserts.



what?   Work Print (WP)-Sometimes   there is such a format, this is a preliminary "beta" version of a movie or a working version. It usually comes out long before the show at the movie theater. The quality varies, is excellent, and can match the screen. At the bottom or top of the screen is a timer that is used for editing. In WP, there may be additional scenes that you cut later, and may include scenes from scenes from the original film. Sometimes special effects and sound drafts may not be enough.



what?   TV-Rip, SAT-Rip   -coded video from television (TVRip) or satellite (SATRip) channels. Usually you can see the channel where the video is encoded, and sometimes the channel is smeared.



Great Quality   -Superior quality that we are used to seeing most of our movies, TV shows, and shows. The movie has great sound, great pictures. If your watch doesn't have an alternative, you don't have good quality   or hard disk space.

what? Telecine (TC)   -The format is very rare, but it occurs. Video in this format is read directly from the projector along with audio and video output. The quality of the video and sound is very good.




what? DVDRip and LDRip   -Video is encoded directly from DVD or CD. Sound and video on top. DVDs and CDs usually incur additional costs for the movie after it is shown in the theater. The disc is designed to be viewed at home. I have long been used to this quality because it is the most popular and convenient to look at.



what? Hdrip   -Can extract from any source in high definition (720p and above, except HDTV) and extract from unknown/unclassified/undefined high-definition sources. The picture quality is better than DVDRip.



Superior Quality   -The last category that evaluates the quality of a movie, so the format in this category is the best for viewing. When watching movies in excellent quality, the person gets the most enjoyment. Choosing a user of better or worse quality is already paying attention to the free space on the hard disk.

what? Bdrip - Rip from image/copy of Blu-ray disc or Blu-Ray Remux. Blu-ray is a large-capacity optical media (up to 50GB) that provides the best high-definition picture and sound quality for your home video. So, using Blu-Ray claims to provide the best image and sound quality. Depending on BDRip's movie source, you'll need dozens to tens of gigabytes. It is also different from the often large image extensions mentioned above.




what? HDDVDRip   - Rip from an HD-DVD disc or an image/copy of an HD-DVD Remux. HD-DVD is a high-capacity optical media (up to 30GB) that offers Blu-ray-like picture quality and high-definition sound.

what? HDTVRip   - Rip to HDTV broadcast or 720p/1080p HDTVRip. HDTV is a high-definition TV broadcast over digital communication channels (cable and satellite networks). Among other high-definition formats, the worst quality of the image is often a serious problem with color reproduction. Often there is an important "artifact", noise, and sometimes a channel logo. However, this format is still better than DVD, image quality, and is now widely spread abroad and will continue to persist in the future.

When you see a good quality movie, you probably don't want to see it as good, better, and bad.

Sound quality
Single channel sound (mono)

In mono, the audio signal comes from one channel.

2-channel sound (stereo)

Stereo sound   (different Greek στερεός "stereos"-"solid, spatial" and φωή-"sound")-recording, transmission or playback of sound-2 (or more) sound layouts to source location via sound layout Saves audio information for. Independent audio channel.
  The basis of stereo is the person's ability to determine the location of the source based on the difference in the stages of sound vibration between the ears due to the finite velocity of the sound. In stereo recording, recording is performed from two microphones separated by a certain distance using separate (right or left) channels. The result is the so-called. "Panorama sound".

Multi-channel sound

Dolby Digital   -5.1-5 channel and spatial sound reproduction system for low frequencies

Dolby Digital Plus   -Spatial Sound Playback System 7.1-7 & 1 Channels for Low Frequency

Dolby TrueHD -8 channel spatial sound reproduction system

DTS (DTS Surround Sound)   -A sound format created by the Digital Theater System that competes with similar Dolby Digital. The DTS format uses a lower level of compression than Dolby, so it sounds better in theory. The DTS stereo format is almost identical to Dolby Surround. DTS supports both 5.1 channel and 7.1 channel audio options.

Movie translation
Duplicate   -translation inaudible to native speakers. It is a type of translation that turns an actor's foreign language into a completely different language.

Professional (dubbed)   -Professional (professional in the channel), i.e. professional
amateur (dubbed) created by a professional manufacturer through the channel or licensed media-  created by amateurs and does not pursue any commercial purpose. It wasn't actually found.

Off-screen   -translation and voice operation with translations superimposed on the original audio track. A native speaker's speech leaves a bit audible, so you can't just jump into the mood of the movie and recognize the actors with the same voice.

Professional (voice over voice)-Created at least 3 voices (Multi VoiceOver).
Amateur (voice over voice)-Made with at least three voices (Multi VoiceOver).
Professional (two-tone outer membrane)-usually consists of two voices, male and female (Dual VoiceOver).
Amateur (two voices on the screen)-performed with two voices, male and female (Dual VoiceOver).
Author (One Voice Voice Over) The author is one person's unofficial one-voice conversion and dubbing, which gained public recognition in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Often we do not know them by sight-we know them by their voice. We do not have the title "People's Interpreter of Russia". But we have people who deserve it. Many popular films have been translated and expressed by those who were remembered for their vocal and sound originality, which aroused the respect of a grateful audience. For them, the search for foreign slang was not a problem. They have always found something easy and seemingly harmless, but in fact a killer word...
Studio (one-voice voiceover) Studio (channel) / Last name-Voice of a professional studio interpreter (VoiceOver) pronounced in one voice. Very rare
Mono Off Screen-Voices are made with one voice, and all monophonic translations (VoiceOver) other than the author or studio are displayed.
Famous author odnogolosy Translation: Alekseev Anton Vasilyevich, Informer Sergei Volodarsky Leonid Veniaminovich Enterprises, Gavrilov Andrei Yurevich Enterprises, Gorchakov Basil Ovidievich, Tripp Alexander Grankin Eugene, Dol'skij Andrew I., Dohalov Bartan Carlo, Dubrovin Vlago Nikolai, Jivov Yuri Viktorovich, Ivanov Mikhail Nikolaevich, Ivashchenko Peter (aka Glanz), Kartsev Peter, Kashkin Alexander (aka Pervomaysky), Kuznetsov Sergey, Libergal Grigory Alexandrovich, Marchenko Alexander Anatolevich, Mikhalev Al ksey M.

Subtitles   -translations are displayed in text format at the top of the image

Original sound   -The movie was not translated because the original language is clear or the movie does not require translation. There are also foreign films with original sounds that are of interest to those who know the language of the original film.


Sometimes people who watch downloaded movies or other videos in TS format are not completely satisfied with the quality of the video. In fact, everyone knows what TS quality means. Telesync or TS-refers to the video taken from the screen. At best, specialized equipment was selected for recording. These videos are shot in the cab or in an empty cinema room. In this case, the sound can be recorded from a separate special output, such as a projector or headphone port. In this case, the sound of the video is without interference and is of good quality in stereo mode. Sound quality is better than CAMRip in this format. Very few cases CAMRip called TS to increase sales.

When shooting video, CAMRip uses a regular cinema, and during the next viewing, the recording is done with other viewers. The sound is also recorded when viewed in the hall. In this format, the video frames sometimes move randomly in all directions, and the camera can rotate at an angle. Watching such a recording, anyone can remember not only the head that appears in the middle of the frame, but also the voices in the foyer and auditorium. There is no such thing in TS format movies. There is also a SuperTS format where the video is processed and improved by a computer. Movies are visible, frames are aligned, and background noise is removed. In general, the quality is acceptable, but it depends on the publisher. I understand what TS means, and now let's see how to determine a really high-quality movie.

How to identify a high-quality movie
To determine the high quality of a movie or other video, you should be able to compare and draw conclusions by defining different formats with TS. Even if the plot is insignificant, there are times when you watch individual movies with only high-definition shooting. On many movie sites and videos of the downloaded movie information, you can see the properties of the shooting quality and consist of several Latin letters, such as DVDRip or TS. With these abbreviations, you can learn how to compress video files and understand the quality and sound quality of images. Next, let's look at some of the most popular notations.



How is TC or Telecine recorded?
The recording comes from the movie. Videos are copied using special equipment. You can also use a projector with digital output. The result is a good quality TS video and the sound is great as well. If the equipment was used to copy good quality, then the video in the license cannot be distinguished.

CAMRip video quality (CAM)
This quality accompanies bad sound and video. Naturally, in the end, they shot him in the middle of regular movie-watching sessions in movies using regular cameras, and more often than in the first row. This quality can be found on torrent sites, as well as on shelves with pirated DVD discs. Signs indicate the various rotations and movements of the picture itself in the frame, as well as the silhouette of a person appearing on the screen. This quality is acceptable only to the most impatient viewers.

DVDScr (DVD Screener, SCR)
This is a beta version of the material. Used for advertising purposes, showing ad critique and other previews. Frames of this video usually contain black and white noise and watermarks. The sound is sometimes good, sometimes with periodic artificial distortion.

What does TVRip mean?
The final video is recorded from a cable or antenna broadcast television signal. These videos are mainly clips, recorded performances, and concerts and TV series. The quality is always good. Also, often in the video there is a logo of the channel where the recording took place.

DVDRip
Record good quality DVD copies. It's usually very voluminous, so it's easy to tear. For DVDRip, use 2 size options-1400 or 700 MB. The first version of the record is often indistinguishable from the original.

HDTVRip
Video recorded on satellite TV. Good quality, both image and sound. The high resolution used -1920*1080 Often the sound is Dolby Digital 5.1. To play these videos, you need a special monitor and playback of the HD standard to display the frames at full resolution. And explained in the article.

HDDVDRip
This is a rip made with HD DVD. Today it is rare. HD DVD is in many ways inferior to the quality of Blu-ray.

WP (WorkPrint)
In this version there is a movie before entering the world employment. Unlike TS, WP is designed for editing and previewing. Although rare, they are distributed as VIDEO-CDs and may vary in quality. They can also be artificially decayed. First of all, this version is bought by movie fans for the collection. You can also include scenes that are not the regular version. The version may not have special effects, but there is a special timer for editing.
